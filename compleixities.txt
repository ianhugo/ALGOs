how many resources does the algo require?
input size: number of itemms or bits
running time: number of primitive operations executed
1: assign time constant to each line
2: determine number of times (iterations) the lines runs
3: total running time = (cost) * iterations
time:
measure by number of writes and reads
think about the constant factors

Merge Sort 
- fastest
- but need more space
- good for large

Quick Sort
- Faster when small
- need less space

Heap Sort
