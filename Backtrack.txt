BACKTRACKING
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq4upTEaQyM

WHEN:
- exhaustive words
- generate ALL, compute ALL
- exhaustion on a decision space
- BUT they could be exponential in time, might be smarter ways

BACKTRACKING: DFS
- choose a path
- does not work out
- go back up
- choose another path
- and so on

(Recursion: sending compact little units, to explore on each level
little minions spawning more little minions)

- using recursion
- express decision space
- express possibilities

1: make Choices (decision space)
2: Constraints on Choices (restricted decision)
3: converge towards Goal (do something)

Choice - Constraint - Goal

-------
1: what Choice are we making at each step?
on what Decision Space are we making Choices

ex Sudoku: fill cell by making choices
key choice= made on a cell
cell has row, column
pass in row and column to solve function

key choice = made on a decision space

1.0.1: Map out Decision Space
- Zooming from out to in
- What is the core/fundamental Choice at the lowest level

1.1: Reduce Decision Space
- decision space: locations/points at which Choices are made
- compartmentalize
- into subproblems
- break it down, deconstruct

ex Sudoku: solve row by row

1.1.1: Zooming in on Decision Space ~ function args
What are the zooming in steps?

ex Sudoku: choose row, choose column


1.2: Express Decision Space . . . actual Choices
what are the possible partial "solutions"

ex Sudoku: 0-9

- express the decision space

ex Sudoku: loop over 0-9

1.3: How to place an item? How to make that choice?

ex Sudoku: board[row][column]

-------
2: Express Constraints
How do we validate our Choice?

ex Sudoku: row, column, subgrid
does placing this number, break any of those?

2.1: Recurse on a valid choice
- recurse becaause this is a partial choice
- want to map out all choices
- pass this decided value down the line

2.2: Recurse to next choice to make
- fanning out
- function receives a state, based on that state, does operations
- makes other choices
- fan out even more
- until hit base case



---------
3: Goal
We want to reach our base cases

3.1: What are the base cases?
- edge cases / out of bounds
- finished all the fanning out (for this branch)

ex Sudoku: reach end of row, reached end of grid

--------- 
4: Finishing Up
We want to build up our solution

4.1: Ejecting undesirable decisions
- remove it

ex Sudoku: cancel the placement of number

4.2: Each call has a goal

ex Sudoku: is the Sudoku solvable given placement just did


FLOW:
1: craft Function based on Choices (larger ones) and Variables
1.1: Subproblem down
2: craft Decision Space 
3: adhere to Constraints
4: converge to Base Case
5: undo Decisions after explored them

6: Explore and Undo
