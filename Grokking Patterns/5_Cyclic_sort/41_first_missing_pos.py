"""
Given: unsorted array of integers
Want: smallest missing positive integer

O(n) time
O(1) space

StrategY:
Exclude negative numbers
- throw all negative numbers to LHS, increment pointer to border

Exclude numbers larger than length

Check if 1 is there, check if 2 is there . . .
HOW?
sort the subarray -> O n lg n


- iterate through 1 to n, positive numbers


LEARNED:
- exclude numbers larger than range

wrong numbers: either left in the hole, or put to the right side
they will be changed around
the editing moves forwards and backwards, 
depending on the value at the inspected index
finally, when looped through find the first positive that is missing

Interesting Solution

Use index as hash key
Use sign of element at index, as hash value

So nums[2] has a -ve sign, means 2 is present
be careful with duplicates to only change sign once


OVERVIEW:
1. check if 1 is present = stop early
2. Knix Negative numbers, Zeros, numbers larger than length
3. iterate over, when encounter element, change sign of related index
4: iterate again, return index of first positive element

O(1) space
