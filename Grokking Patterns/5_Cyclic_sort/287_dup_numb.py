"""
Without modifying the array?

STRATEGY: 
- fast and slow poitners
- slow pointer = start at 0
- fast pointer = start at correc tpos of the number at index 0
- while not equal, keep looping
- stop = found a duplicate

Intuition:
nums[x], nums[nums[x]], nums[nums[nums[x]]],
- go to the real place of that number
- if duplicate, will go to the real place twice
- thus there is a cycle
- with fast slow pointers, will meet at a duplicate

Learned:
Cyclic sort -> linked list/cycle

O(n) time
