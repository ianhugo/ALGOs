"""
STATEMENT:
Given: str1, pattern
Want: 
- Bool
- if str1 contains substring of any permutation of pattern

Permutation: re-arranging of characters of string

STRATEGY:
- sliding window
- process pattern -> hash map[char] = [target, curr, last_pos]
- wind_start, exist_bool, all_chars_bool
- iterate wind_end
- if wind_end is a key, check if already have target number
    - if not, continue
    - if so, shrink, and decrement stuff, until last_pos
- stop when?

LEARNED:
hacky type things
might be solved by balancing restrictions
need to check less things
