STATEMENT:
Given: string
Want: substring that is longest
    with distinct characters

STRATEGY:
- max_length, max_start
- wind_start, wind_end
- alphabet hash 
- increment until find duplicate character
- shrink until no more duplicate character
- update max_length, max_start (with wind_start)
- update char map[new_char] = position
- check, if char already taken
- take max between last position and cur wind_start = new wind_start
