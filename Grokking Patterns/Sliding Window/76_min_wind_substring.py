"""
STATEMENT:
Given: string, pattern
Want: minimum window substring
- including all characters

STRATEGY:
- sliding window
- min_length
- hash map similar logic to str_permute
- shrink until: hit all again

OPTIMIZATION:
iteration depends on the string being window slide over
O(n + m)
do another pre: where filter the string for only characters there
keep track of the non-filtered positions
