Given: arr of intervals
Want; min # rooms required

Observation:
if conflict between two = need two rooms
if conflict between three = need three rooms . . .

Strategy:
- iterate through
- keep track of curr_end vs next_start

Learned:
- need to sort anyway
- can use data structs
- don't be obsessed with time and space, to create wrong implements
- make sure logic works first

Example:
Schedule m1 in r1
Schedule m2 in r2
Schedule m3 in which room?  = need to know which ends first

NEED:
sorting
keep track of mutual exclusivity
keep track of ending time of all meetings happening
= use a min heap

Heap use:
- add to min-heap
- when put in m_k
- remove all meetings ended before m_k
- add m_k
- heap has all overlapping meetings
- use counter to remember max size of heap = min rooms needed
