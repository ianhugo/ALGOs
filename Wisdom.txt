Algorithms set developers apart
Algorithms are everywhere.

Algorithms are a specific set of clearly
defined instructions
aimed to carry out a task or process (fast)

Algorithms involve
creative, elegant ways to implement a solution
creative and efficient use of data structures

Algorithms allow one to peek
under the hood of SQL and Linux commands

Algorithms are about performance
an algorithm is a technology

Algorithms are
compact and simple pieces of logic, 
working perfectly to perform a single task

Donald Knuth:
father of analysis of algorithms
“People who analyze algorithms have double happiness. 
First of all they experience the sheer beauty of elegant 
mathematical patterns that surround computational procedures. 
Then they receive a practical payoff when their theories make 
it possible to get other jobs done more quickly and economically.”

LESSONS from the field:
- always reclarify the problem
- work with a few examples
- note down the different goals/milestones
- try a brute force
- plan out functions before implement
- anchor problems in patterns (confidence)
- have structure to thinking

Observation 1:
An approach might not work completely
But that does not mean abandon immediately
It might be a half way solution
Note down what it solves
Note down what it is lacking
Breaking down problems into smaller ones

Observation 2: (esp DP)
Try to reduce outcomes into cases
Where other cases collapse to these cases
Draw a line in the sand then adjust

Observation 3:
have multiple thoughts
sketch out what happens
why it would or won't work
what is missing

Observation 4:
What are the implications/corollories of this result?
