have to iterate whole subarray to ensure it is minimum

“opposite of Insertion Sort”
1. Work left to right of array
2. At each index_k, loop right
	1. pointer1 = minimum current (min_idx)
	2. pointer2 = iterate through (j)
	3. set both as index_k to start
	4. iterate through, find the minimum
3. switch pointer1 and index_k
4. increment index_k

iterate two pointers
select the minimum, dump it into the partition each time
