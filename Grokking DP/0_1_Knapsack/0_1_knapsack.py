General Pattern

Given: 
- weight and profits of N items (two attributes)
- limit on capacity weight (restriction on one attribute)  
- 0/1, each item only once

Want: 
- maximize profit
- optimize on non-restricted attribute

Top-Down Memoization

O(N * C) space and time
C = capacity

What is the DP table?
- what is changing?
- what capacity?
- given choice, what profit?
(NOTE: choice can be saved elsewhere)

IDEA:
- yes or no include this item
- if yes, decrement capacity, consider next item yes or no
- if no, keep capacity, consider next item yes or no
- thus consider all permutations
- with memoization cancel redundant computation

Visual:
- 2-d table
- each row = items
- each column = remaining capacity
- start at right low tip
- include item, jump across capacity on same row, then go up
- not include, go up one row, same capacity
- for both, now consider include or not include

- on recursive call-back
- included: profit of item + recursed max
- not included: recursed max
- take maxima

IDEA: 
- have the profit if include this item
    - recursed with less capacity
- have the profit if not include this item
    - recursed with more capacity

Observation:
- "delayed" computation
- post-processing
